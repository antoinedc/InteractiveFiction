<h3>282</h3>

<p>Looking above the heads of the crowd, you notice that one of the shops opposite the main gate is the timbered surgery of a city physician. Suddenly, a bold plan springs to mind. Bracing yourself against the tide of bodies, you struggle across to the other side of the street. You quickly enter to find that there is no sign of life, apart from a brightly coloured parrot in its cage by the window.</p>
<p>Taking a selection of small bottles you slip on a white surgeon’s cloak, and fight your way back to the main gate. ‘An emergency!’ you bluff, as guards stop and question you. ‘It’s the royal cook’s wife … she’s having a baby.’</p>
<p>The guards hesitate for a moment, but you assure them that the matter is most urgent and they decide to let you in. One of the great doors swings open about two feet, and you are roughly pushed through the narrow gap into the courtyard beyond.</p>
