At last you have a bit of peace and quiet. The chatter of the other explorers
fade into the distance as you hike into the warm forest up the slopes of
the island's only mountain. You're following the flow of a babbling little
stream.
*line_break
This is the first time that you're on your own in a long time. After many weeks
at sea, your expedition set foot on this small, uncharted island this morning.
You decided to do a little bit of exploration of your own, while the rest of
the team sets up camp.
*line_break
As you look back through the trees, you can see the furled sails of the Zuiderkruis,
the sloop that brought you to this distant place. The sunny port of Cape Town,
your home town from where you left on this expedition, seems very far away.

You suddenly hear a deep rumbling, and the ground trembles underneath your
feet. Birds noisily fly up from the trees around you.

What will you do?

        *label { The Camp }
        The camp site is not too far from the beach, next to the stream
        that you were following up the mountain. When you left (barely an
        hour ago!) the crew of the Zuiderkruis was hard at work setting up
        a base from which the island could be explored. Now, however, no-one
        is in sight. An ominous silence hangs over the deserted camp. Smoke
        from a cooking fire draws a twisted plume into the sky.
        *line_break
        You can see the Zuiderkruis a short distance into the open sea, but
        the rowing boats you could use to get back to the ship, are nowhere
        to be seen. Further down the beach you see something that has washed
        ashore &mdash; perhaps it's one of the rowing boats; maybe only flotsam.

                You swim as hard as you can, but the current pulls you hard away
                from the ship. You may be able to reach the ship, but your
                arms are already burning from the effort?

                        The current feels as if it is getting stronger, but you
                        push ahead nonetheless. Suddenly, you feel the sharp burn
                        of a cramp in your right leg! You try to keep afloat, but
                        your are just too tired. It's almost a relief when you
                        feel the cool water close over your head.

                        It takes almost all the energy you have left to turn around
                        and swim back. Just before reaching the shore, you feel the
                        sharp burn of a cramp in your right leg! Fortunately, you manage
                        to keep calm and ride the waves back onto the shore.
