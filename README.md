InteractiveFiction
==================

Interactive fiction project - Stellenbosch University

This project aim to propose to writers an easy way for writing "interactive books",
These books are like the "choose your own adventure" books for example, at each paraagraph
you have several choices, and the rest of the story will change depending of your choices.

Writers will have an intuitive interface, easy to understand and will be able to write complex
stories, with only their imagination as limit !
This platform will also allow them to export the story in different format:
	- They will get a link for sharing their story, everyone will be able to read it inside
	  a browser
	- On Amazon Kindle
	- On Mxit
	- On any mobile phone: not necessarily smartphone
