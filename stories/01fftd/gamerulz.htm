<h2>The Game Rules</h2>

<p>You keep a record of your adventure on the <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a>.</p>
<p>During your training as a Kai Lord you have developed fighting prowess—<span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> and physical stamina—<span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Before you set off on your adventure you need to measure how effective your training has been. To do this take a pencil and, with your eyes closed, point with the blunt end of it onto the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a>. If you pick 0 it counts as zero.</p>
<p>The first number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> in this way represents your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span>. Add 10 to the number you picked and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 4 in the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would write in a <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> of 14). When you fight, your <span class="smallcaps">COMBAT SKILL</span> will be pitted against that of your enemy. A high score in this section is therefore very desirable.</p>
<p>The second number that you pick from the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> represents your powers of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span>. Add 20 to this number and write the total in the <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> section of your <a href="action.htm">Action Chart</a> (i.e. if your pencil fell on the number 6 on the <a href="random.htm">Random Number Table</a> you would have 26 <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points).</p>
<p>If you are wounded in combat you will lose <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points. If at any time your <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points fall to zero or below, you are dead and the adventure is over. Lost <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can be regained during the course of the adventure, but your number of <span class="smallcaps">ENDURANCE</span> points can never go above the number with which you start your adventure.</p>
